<h2>Solutions to common issues</h2>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#top">To the top</a></div>
</header>

<h4 id="settings_access">“I can’t access the extension’s preferences!”</h4>

<p>Right-click anywhere on a web page (for example HERE) except on a placeholder and the command “ClickToPlugin Preferences…” will appear. If it does not, try using the default keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌥,</kbd> (Option-Comma), making sure that the current web page has focus.</p>
<p>If you have modified this default keyboard shortcut and cannot remember the new shortcut, quit Safari and restore the shortcut menu item using the following Terminal command:</p>
<pre>defaults write com.apple.Safari ExtensionSettings-com.hoyois.safari.clicktoplugin-GY5KR7239Q -dict-add settingsContext -string 'true'</pre>

<h4 id="broken_page">“I found a web page that does not work with ClickToPlugin enabled, but does when ClickToPlugin is disabled. Surely there is a bug in ClickToPlugin!”</h4>

<p>More likely the web page’s functionality relies on a hidden or very small plug-in object which ClickToPlugin blocks. In many cases the “Load All Plug-ins” command is enough to restore the web page to a working state. A permanent solution for all cases is the following. Select the “Block plug-ins manually” checkbox in the preferences and reload the page. For every plug-in object on the page, a dialog will appear: click OK to block the object and Cancel to load it. Use this to find out which objects must be loaded for the page to work, and match their sources (given in the dialogs) using the sources whitelist. See also the <a href="#common_invisible">list of common invisible elements</a> below.</p>

<h4 id="download_qtp_airplay">“This video cannot be downloaded/viewed in QuickTime Player/viewed on my AirPlay device!”</h4>

<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons over which ClickToPlugin has no control. For example, the server can refuse to respond to requests made from Safari’s downloader or from an Apple TV, and there are video formats that can be played in Safari but not in QuickTime Player or on a given AirPlay device.</p>

<p>Known cases include Vimeo videos, which cannot be viewed on an Apple TV, and Dailymotion videos, which can be played neither in QuickTime Player nor on an Apple TV.</p>

<h4 id="broken_apple_tv">“Whenever I send videos to my Apple TV, they stop playing automatically after a while!”</h4>

<p>Apple TV software versions 4.4 and later are not compatible with the extension anymore. I’m hoping that this will be fixed in a future Apple TV software update, but in the meantime the only way to enjoy this feature is to downgrade the Apple TV software to version 4.3.</p>

<h4 id="ineffective_whitelist">“I whitelisted a page but some plug-ins are still being blocked!”</h4>

<p>This is because a single tab can contain documents whose URLs are different than the URL displayed in the Address Field. To find out the URL of the document containing a blocked object, select the “Block plug-ins manually” checkbox in the preferences, right-click the object’s placeholder, and choose “Get Plug-in Info”.</p>

<h4>“I’ve read this whole page carefully but I still have a problem!”</h4>

<p>Uninstall and reinstall the extension (this will reset the extension’s settings). If that doesn’t fix your problem, then you can <a href="./#contact">contact me</a> and I’ll be happy to help.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#top">To the top</a></div>
</header>

<h4 class="question">Does the replacement of plug-ins by HTML5 require the plug-in to be installed?</h4>
<p class="answer">No. However, websites can check if your browser supports a given plug-in, and change the page accordingly. For example, Vimeo and Dailymotion do not insert the Flash player into the page unless Flash is enabled, so there’s nothing for ClickToPlugin to replace.</p>

<h4 class="question">Can I use wild cards in the whitelists?</h4>
<p class="answer">All whitelist-like text fields in the preferences support regular expressions. For a string to be considered as a regular expression, it must be preceded by the <code>@</code> symbol. These regular expressions must follow the Javascript syntax (in particular, lookbehinds are not supported). Invalid regular expressions are ignored.</p>

<h4 class="question">Can you move the extension’s preferences back to the dedicated area in Safari’s preferences?</h4>
<p class="answer">Not until all of the following are possible within that dedicated area: language localization; displaying the list of installed plug-ins; customizable keyboard shortcuts; multiline text areas.</p>

<h4 class="question">Could you add HTML5 replacements for …?</h4>
<p class="answer">Maybe. Contact me with as much information as possible on the videos you’d like to see replaced, including at least:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a link to a page with a video;</li>
	<li>if the plug-in-based player offers several video resolutions, links to pages showcasing varying available resolutions;</li>
	<li>links to the plug-in-based player documentation if there is one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I will not be adding killers to the extension from now on. New killers will be uploaded <a href="killers.xhtml#database">here</a> and can be installed following <a href="killers.xhtml#add_killers">these instructions</a>. You can also <a href="killers.xhtml#create_killers">make killers yourself</a> and send them to me for sharing.</p>

<h4 class="question">Why would I want to allow invisible plug-ins?</h4>
<p class="answer">You don’t. For security and privacy reasons, automatically allowing invisible plug-ins on random pages is not recommended: they are often used to spy on your browsing habits and can store cookies that bypass any of the browser’s privacy settings. Also, it is possible for a plug-in object to be small at first but grow once it is loaded.</p>

<h4 class="question">Why does ClickToPlugin slow down the SunSpider Javascript benchmark?</h4>
<p class="answer">This is a <a href="#safari_bugs">bug in Safari</a> which affects all extensions that use messaging from the global page to content scripts. It does not indicate that there is something wrong with these extensions, nor that they have a negative effect on Safari’s performance in real-life usage.</p>

<p>In the case of ClickToPlugin, removing the unique listener to <code>message</code> events from the content scripts (which is not needed for ClickToPlugin’s core functionality) results in a SunSpider benchmark which is identical to that obtained with no extensions.</p>

<h4 class="question">What license is your code under?</h4>
<p class="answer">None. Feel free to use it in any way.</p>
